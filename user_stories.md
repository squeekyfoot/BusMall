# User Stories - A BusMall Study

## Persons Involved:
#### Marketing Research Team
#### The Developer
#### The Focus Group Participant

## User Stories:

* As a marketing research team for the new startup, BusMall, we would like to gather user data on which products they would rather purchase so that we can decide which items we would like to feature in our magazines.

* As the developer for the BusMall survey, I would like to reuse code as much as necessary so that I may save time actually writing this program and to keep the code organized.

* As a focus group participant for the BusMall survey, I would like to be able to navigate very quickly through the questions because I am not a huge fan of surveys and would just like to collect my money.

* As the marketing team, we would like the user to get visual feedback (or response) from their questionnaire so that they feel more involved in the results of the survey.

* As a developer for the survey, I would like the all of the survey to be contained in one page so that the user doesn't have to navigate through multiple pages just to take this survey.

* As a participant of the survey, I'd like the item to have a name or a description of it before I click on it because I'd like to know about the products that I haven't seen before.

* As the marketing research team, we want to show products from multiple categories so that we can reach a many different types of interests.

* As the developer, I only want to provide a possibility of two interactions with the page so that there is less room for errors or bugs on the page.

* As a participant, I would like all of the images easy to see because I am vision impaired and I'd like to give accurate results to the marketing group.

* As the Marketing Research Team, we would like to make sure the participants have a question counter to keep track of their progress in the survey so they will know how close they are to finishing.

* As a developer, I will want the participants or users to be able to resize the window or use the survey on a variety of devices so that more people will have access to the page.

* As a survey participant, I would like the survey to be easy to navigate and click through because I am not that coordinated with using a computer mouse.
